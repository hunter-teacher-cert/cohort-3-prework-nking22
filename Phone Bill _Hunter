#Problem Statement: The program will read Customer Name, Phone Plan, number of minutes, number of texts used and number of megabytes. It should determine each customer’s cost per minute, cost per text and cost per megabyte based on rates given. The program should calculate the final bill for all post-paid customers. The name of the customer along with the final bill, phone plan and then total revenue should be printed on the screen.

#Constants

Cost_Text_Nuff = 2.00
